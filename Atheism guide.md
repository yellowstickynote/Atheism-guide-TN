# About this post

Many years ago I lost faith in the existence of a god, like many others in this subreddit and in Tunisia in general.
I was 14 back then, and was very confused of what to make of my new realization.
Everything started to seem different and I started to feel disconnected from everyone around me. For a while I started thinking that I was maybe going insane, because while my reasons to stop believing in god where very strong and logical -and I had already spent more than a year researching different views- I still couldn't comprehend why I was the only one in this country that thought of this.

That was until I discovered this subreddit, a place that, for reasons I still don't understand, attracts a high number of atheists from all different backgrounds. It helped me realize that there are in fact people like me and that they are everywhere, which was extremely valuable information in a time when I was feeling very vulnerable and alone.

And while most people here were very nice and well-intentioned, some of the advice I received wasn't the best, and most of them were mainly focused on debating religion and convincing you that god does not exist, and few actually focused on how to navigate this new reality that one finds himself in.

Ans so, I'm writing this post in hopes that it helps someone who's going through the same situation that 14 yo me went through, because I know that it can be quite a lonely experience for a lot of people.

## What this ISN'T

This is not trying to convince you of anything. In fact, nowhere in this post do I claim that god does or does not exist, neither do I try to convince anyone of my views. This is meant to help people who are struggling with/left Islam (because that's the major religion in this country, although I imagine that ex-jews or ex-christians or other religions can benefit from this).

## My vision 

In the future, I wish for this to be a community effort. I'm certain that there are many things that the more experienced atheists can offer that simply wouldn't cross my mind. 

I also wish that this post becomes the gold standard in the atheist community for helping newcomers settle and deal with the emotional toll that comes with losing faith in something that for some of us made the majority of our childhoods. 

I would be very excited to receive contributions from anyone who wishes to add or change anything to this place. [Here is the github repo if you're interested](https://github.com/yellowstickynote/Atheism-guide-TN) 

## Why is it so long

I touch on many things here, and you might not even be concerned with all of them. Feel free to gloss over the titles and read the parts that peak your interest, although I encourage you to read it in its entirety, because I think it will be beneficial.

# So, how should you feel about all this ?

## first of all, you're not alone

You're really not. There are lots of us, in fact I believe we make up a significant minority of the population (although I have no data to back this up, it's completely my gut feeling, [because Wikipedia says otherwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Tunisia#Religion) ). Also, we're diverse, so don't think you're not welcome in this community because you don't fit within a certain category or stereotype, and by that I mean how your typical uncle perceives atheists: chaotic and evil with no sense of purpose and who's only goals are sex and drinking, also probably a bit satanic because why else would you stop believing in god.


## So if god doesn't exist, why shouldn't I do whatever I want

This point requires its own post. Ethics. It's usually the biggest issue that an atheist/agnostic faces, and not just in the beginning.
Ethics is the philosophy of morals, basically what's right to do and what's wrong to do.
Finding a good set of ethical laws (or deciding that there aren't any) is one of the missions you're going to have to take on your own, you can't take an answer for granted. 
Because, if you don't believe in creationist narrative, then you should be aware that we simply don't have a coherent idea about the beginning of the universe (although we know much more than some people would lead you to believe), and we also don't know everything about morality.
It's an open ended question, you're going to have to decide on your own if you only do what's right because you don't want to go to jail, or if you have a set of principles that guide your life (I personally do, so do most people I know).

## I gave up on my religion, and now I feel like life is meaningless

This is linked to the previous point I made. I can't give you a good answer on the meaning of life.
Some people would tell you you should just carry on your DNA and live to provide for your family then die.
Others would tell you that you're meant to work and benefit the larger society.
Others still would tell you that you live to have the most pleasant experiences and to be happy;
Or maybe that life is meaningless and that you're not meant for anything really, just a chemical reaction that's waiting to finish.
And still many others. The thing is, none of them are obviously wrong, and none of them are obviously right. 
You're going to have to face that question (or avoid it), and when you come up with an answer, it would be an answer that you've reached with your reasoning, and you'll stick with it because it you weren't forced by society to accept it as a child.

# How you should interact with others.

This is the part that I really want to talk about a lot, because it's the part that bothered me the most as a teenager, and the one that I wished I got help with. 
Your relationships and how you view your friends and family are going to change, that is certain. I'm hoping to give you some advice on how to deal with these changes, and what to expect from those around you.
## "I know a few atheists from school/work, I'd rather eat shit than hang out with those people"

I'll be the first to admit that there are some out there that have personalities that may seem quirky and off-putting to most people. You shouldn't judge, but you're welcome not to hang out with them. Most of us on the other hand, are much more "normal", in the sense that we fit a lot better in Tunisian society and norms (except the entire being muslim bit), and some even pretend to be muslim for reasons I'll get into later. So you shouldn't feel disconnected from the general non-believer community, because being disconnected is a feeling you're probably already dealing with in a lot of other places, including maybe your own family. 

## "Should I tell my family ?"

NO DON'T EVEN CONSIDER IT. 
Well at least not so fast. You should be careful before doing that. 
First, no matter how much you love your family, if they're devout, just don't tell them. 
In the best case, they'll try to accept you, but it will make every interaction a lot more awkward. For a mom/dad who think that everyone who doesn't believe in god is certainly going to hell, saving you from hell would be their top priority, and it will be very annoying. 
And in the worst case, it can get extremely dangerous. Even people who aren't fundamentalists can get extremely aggressive with non believers. It's simply a risk not worth taking.
Now if your family aren't particularly connected with religion, like if your father drinks regularly or whatever, I still would advise against it. Most people, although they barely follow the teachings of Islam, believe that they're simply doing something wrong but that their hearts are pure, and would never classify themselves as atheists or even anything close.
Now if you feel strongly about telling them, by all means. But you should keep in mind that the results can be very unpredictable and can make your life a serious pain in the ass, or worse.

## "Ok so no family, what about your friends"

Nope, not even. 
Well again, not so fast at least.
Everything that I said previously applies, plus extra pain in the ass. 
You might lose some dear friends, even if they break a verse of the quran every .5 seconds. 
The word might spread, and you might get messages from that one religious dude who's hoping to convert you back. 
You'll get into a lot of heated arguments, and fights. Maybe some random piece of shit decided to become a jihadist and is getting some stupid ideas. 
Even if you plan to tell another atheist, I would move with care. Even if he and his friend group might be thrilled about it, they might tell the wrong person, and that shit spreads like wildfire. 
 Of course, you have the final say in all of this. If you trust someone very much and really want to tell them, who am I to tell you otherwise. I'm just giving you possibilities you should consider. 
## "But this can't be healthy, I can't keep this to myself, and keep lying to everyone for the rest of my life"

I feel you very much. I'm in the exact same position, and it does such to have to lie to almost everyone I know about something as fundamental as your religious beliefs. 
Although progressive compared to other arab countries, Tunisia sadly still remains very hostile towards non-muslims, the not-as-educated population, and I simply don't feel safe telling people openly that I don't believe in their god. Remember, tunisia's official religion is islam in the constitution, that is the will of the people.
I hope that through activism we can make this place more welcoming towards people of different beliefs (and more welcoming in general, because the recent wave of racism is depressing), but until then, we're going to have to be careful. 

## Where you can vent

Here. I know some people get bored of the frequent discussions of religion in this sub, but I think we should just accept it. Atheists make a big percentage of the users here, so this is one of the safest places to discuss such topics. 
In addition, if you're careful enough, you can remain anonymous so no one can even know who you are, for an added level of security. 
There are probably other communities out there for the tunisian atheist population, so anyone who's reading this[ feel free to contribute](https://github.com/yellowstickynote/Atheism-guide-TN) a list of discord servers/fb groups/ whatever that you know.

## One more thing, we might disagree with muslims, but we MUST respect everyone.

This is very important. I feel like a lot of people who leave islam suddenly feel like they are an enlightened bunch who found the answer to the mysteries of the universe. 
I can point out 10 muslims off the top of my head that have each contributed more to science and society then you and I and everyone in this sub will contribute in 10 lifetimes. 
And you might rightfully ask, if they're so smart, how come they believe in such ridiculous things. 
And to that I say, it's a psychological thing. Islam to them is an identity, it's who they are and what they lived their entire lives for. You'll encounter very bright people that simply refuse to consider the contradictions that modern science has with the qur'an, and they manage to simultaneously believe in both. 
It's not, not even remotely, a sign of lack of intelligence. 
It's like me telling you your mother is a whore. You wouldn't research whether your mother is a whore, you won't consider the philosophical implications of your mother being a whore, to you it's not even a discussion worth having, because there is no fucking way it would be true. You'll simply beat the living shit out of me, or if you're nice tell me to fuck off. 
Atheists aren't intelligent people, we're simply the ones that started to wonder whether our mother is really actually a whore. 

PS: it's just an analogy to get the point across, don't take it seriously.
